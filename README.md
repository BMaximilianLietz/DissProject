# Dissertation Project Description
A project that attempts to find a suitable price for a given software project depending on different variables.

The underlying basis for receiving a price is a combination of theoretical implementations as well as a simple AI model.

Goals for the future would be to add pricing history so that machine learning could be implemented to complement the current AI model.
